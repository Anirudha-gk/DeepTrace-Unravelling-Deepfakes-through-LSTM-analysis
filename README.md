# DeepTrace-Unravelling-Deepfakes-through-LSTM-analysis

A deepfake creation and detection system leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms combines advanced machine learning techniques to manipulate and identify fraudulent multimedia content. In the creation process, LSTMs capture temporal dependencies across video frames, generating realistic yet fake videos by altering facial expressions, lip movements, or entire identities. This involves preprocessing data, extracting frames, and normalizing them before training a model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial features and LSTMs for temporal coherence. For detection, LSTMs analyze sequential data to spot inconsistencies in temporal dynamics that may not be evident in individual frames, making them particularly effective at identifying subtle temporal artifacts and anomalies indicative of deepfakes. This dual application showcases the versatility of LSTMs in both creating and combating sophisticated forgeries.
